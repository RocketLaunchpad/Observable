import Combine

/// This provides the equivalent of a private subject and a public (or internal)
/// publisher.
///
/// Instead of writing this:
///
/// ```
/// private let valueSubject: CurrentValueSubject<String, Never> = .init(â€œfoo")
/// lazy var value: AnyPublisher<String, Never> = {
///     valueSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
/// }()
/// ```
///
/// You can write this:
///
/// ```
/// @Observable
/// private(set) var value: String = "foo"
/// ```
///
/// From within the declaring scope, you can write to `value` (since it was
/// declared `private(set)`. From anywhere the declaring scope is visible, you
/// can access the underlying publisher by `$value`.
///
/// This is similar to `@Published` except it will not trigger an
/// `objectWillChange` event on a containing `ObservableObject`.
